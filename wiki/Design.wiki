= Introduction =
We lay out the design for the project here. This will help a lot when we do our writeup, as we will be able to copy most of it directly to the writeup.

==Initial Setup==
  * we need to read in the sequence from a FASTA file. We are thinking of using BioJava for this, but need to evaluate it's ease of use and performance.
  * We need some kind of HMM object that will store the parameters for the model
  * We need to iterate over the sequence with the object, and output the most probable original state.
